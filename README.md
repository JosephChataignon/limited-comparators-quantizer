# limited-comparators-quantizer
The goal here is to design a quantizer using a lesser comparator than the standard approach would need. Comparators act like hyperplanes in the vector space, that divide space in diverse quantization regions. The goal is to position those hyperplanes in a way that minimizes the quantization distortion.
