# limited-comparators-quantizer
New repo because the previous one had become a mess.
Design a quantizer whith a lesser amounter of comparators. Comparators act like hyperplanes in the vector space, that divide space in diverse quantization regions. The goal is to position those hyperplanes such as to minimize the quantization distortion.
